== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is malware scanned? =

We use malware detection patterns extracted from millions of WordPress malware codes that we have collected, and we perform a comprehensive scan of WordPress PHP files, image files, HTACCESS files, etc.

= Do I need to register for any services to scan for malware? =

No, you do not need to. You only need to install and activate the plugin to scan for malware.

= Auto scaning does not start at the scheduled time. =

Auto scaning of malware scanner uses the auto-execution function of WordPress. This function is triggered only when there is an access to the website.
If there is no access in the scheduled time zone, execution of auto scaning may be delayed.

= Scanning takes too much time. =

The execution time of malware scanning depends on the number of files. If there are a lot of files to be scanned, scanning may take several minutes at least, or more than 10 minutes to complete.

= Can I switch the screen during scanning? =

Scanning will be stopped, but the files are scanned properly and are recorded up to that point. Please restart scanning or wait until auto scaning is completed.

= Does this plugin rely on any third-party services? =

No. However, a professional version of the plugin is presented on the plugin's administration page by Youtube video.
